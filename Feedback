Neev,
It was a pleasure going thru your solution. Excellent work on the challenge problem attempt. 
Appreciate your segmentation on the solution, breaking into neat blocks and providing the necessary continuity, moving from block to block, 
while going thru your uploaded code.

A few points that I wish you can respond on : 
(1) Did you have a team member(s) that you worked along with on the challenge or it is a solo effort. This is just for my clarity.
(2) Maybe a little more documentation at the start of each block, just for more routine completeness.
(3) What if any, are your thoughts on using pytorch vs not using pytorch, a summary note.

Barring that, hats off on your solution provided.  
We would like to ask you if you are willing to accept an internship offer with our organization Myelin Foundry. Details can be worked out,
based on your response to this offer.
Please do let us know. You have my emailid : vasant@myelinfoundry.com
Wishing you the best
Vasant
